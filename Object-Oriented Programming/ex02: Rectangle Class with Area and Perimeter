Objective

The objective of this exercise is to strengthen understanding of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) by:

Creating a class that models a real-world object (a rectangle)
Defining attributes and methods within a class
Performing mathematical calculations using object methods
Instantiating an object and accessing its behaviors
This exercise reinforces the practical use of classes, methods, and objects in programming.

Instructions

Create a class called Rectangle.
Add two methods using the attributes length and width:
calculate_area() that returns the area of the rectangle (length × width).
calculate_perimeter() that returns the perimeter of the rectangle ((length + width) × 2).
Create an object of the Rectangle class with a length and a width of your choice, then display its area and perimeter.
