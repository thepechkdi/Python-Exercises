Exercise 5 :

Write a program that asks the user to enter the price of an item (before tax) and the VAT rate, calculates the total price including tax (TTC), and displays the result.

The formula is: price_ttc←price_ht + ( price_ht×tva /100 )
 
Where:

price_ht = price before tax
tva = VAT rate
price_ttc = price including tax
